# yield_curve_library
A C++ yield curve fitting library that implements Nelson-Siegel, Svensson, and Cubic Spline models, supports multiple optimization techniques (Gradient Descent, Levenberg-Marquardt, BFGS, Nelder-Mead, Ceres Solver), and includes Google Test (gtest) for validation, with plans for graphing yield curves in C++.
